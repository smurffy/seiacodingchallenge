Correctness (score out of 5) score: 2 -- 'formatted_time' inforrectly named 'epoch_ms', errors returned status code 200 instead of 400, error buffer is kinda broken: does not store or clear correctly, some misformatted strings describe the error instead of returning 'bad response' (unintentionally)
Do all test cases pass? (score out of 3) (some leniency for errors)
- Are errors properly stored and cleared? (score: 2)

Code quality (score out of 4) score: 3 -- code is well formatted and documentation and readme are included, however, the code architecture is a little strange. One function has 4 wrappers. Seems a little excessive to me, and takes away from the readability for sure.
- Does the architecture make sense? (2)
- Is the code well commented? (1)
- Is there a readme / other instructions? (1)
- Is the number of files reasonable for the task?

Submission (score out of 1) score: 1
- Is the API hosted on the public internet?
- Is the response time within reason?

Bonus
- Are tests written? (score out of +1) score: +.5 -- Couple of tests 
- Is the error buffer persistent of a server restart? (out of +1)

Minus 
- Is the code submitted through Google Drive (or similar) and not zipped? score: -1

Total: 6.5/10
